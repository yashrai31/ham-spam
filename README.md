Spam Email Detector
A project that takes a csv datatype which contains thousands of emails received by a person which have been classified as spam and ham. Using this dataset I have built a programme using the NLTK(natural language processing library)  & re python library, which removes all stopwords, punctuations etc. Using different probabilistic classification algorithms based on Bayesâ€™s theorem to achieve best accuracy score through the confusion matrix and hence classifying emails as either ham or spam.
